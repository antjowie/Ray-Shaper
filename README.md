# Purpose
This game is the game I made for NHTV. The theme is reflections and therefore this game is based around lasers.
It doesn't take a creative person to think that up, but the reason why I chose lasers is because I wanted to display my capabilities as a programmer.
Sure it isn't the most creative thing, but I wanted to be sure that I can display the skills I posses, and not make a half finished game based
around a theme that I couldn't finish in time.

So to keep it simple. Ray Shaper is a game that contains all I know. Of course, new things are added in the game too, the most complicated of all
is probably the lasers. But enough said about the game, if you made it this far, you should already be playing it.

# Download
The game can be downloaded via my Google Drive [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1HnHZUPI-AYm1g8gb9E_X2jkpqDRxm6OK).  
You can build the game yourself if you want to but I can't remember which version of [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) was used for this game.
So you have to download SFML yourself and fix all the libraries and include directories and all that stuff. I also don't know in which version
of Visual Studio this game was built, but you can use the latest, I hope. 

Either way, good luck with my small game. Be sure to leave a comment [on my portfolio](https://antjowie.github.io/post/my-journey-towards-nhtv/) about it!
